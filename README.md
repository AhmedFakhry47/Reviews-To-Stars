# Reviews To Stars

My implementation of Kim Yoonâ€™s Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification.\

<p>The network architecture consists mainly of three blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-First block is for words embedding.</li>
<li>2-Second block is one dimensional CNN with multiple filters to extract several relations that can be found between sentences.</li>
<li>3-Third block is max pooling block and concatenation block to concatenate the features before the softmax.</li> 
</ul>
